# Takeaways from previous iteration V1.0

- Accessibility features were not expanded on enough
- Needed a space for news and updates to help the data scientists give the public updates on their findings and changes.
- Users need to be able to access what the indicators actually mean
- Homepage navigation to key features need more emphasis to make users navigate to them naturally


# What has changed since the previous iteration

- Each indicator in an economic region will now have a zipped file format for download.
- Map legends are now being served within the map from the [Map Server](https://maps-cartes.services.geo.ca/server_serveur/rest/services/NRCan/nhsl_en/MapServer)
- Carousel to key website features on the homepage
